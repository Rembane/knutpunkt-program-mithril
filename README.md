# README

This is the Knutpunkt Program viewer.

## Parts

- It is built in Javascript using [Mithril 2.2](https://mithril.js.org/).
- [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) is used to bundle everything.

## How to develop

`src/main.js` is a good place to start, then run `npm run watch` to get a server that automatically packs and reloads the code. You need access to the backend to do something useful with the code, contact me to get access.
